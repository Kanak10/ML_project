## End to End Machine Learning Project

Setps to setup project:
    1. Write exception handling in src/exception.py and loggs in src/logger.py
    2. Create folder src/components and have different python file, we will talk about them later.
    3. Create notebook folder in which data is present.
    4. Do EDA in notebook folder then model training.
    5. Now it time to read the data in src/components/data_integration.py and split the data into train and test.
    6. Now we do data transformation in which there is feature engineering, data cleaning, data encoding.
    7. Now we are train our model on different-different algos in src/components/model_trainer.py.
    8. Assignment to do hyperperameter tunning.
